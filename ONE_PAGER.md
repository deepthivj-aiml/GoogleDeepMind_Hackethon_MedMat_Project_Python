# PROJECT DOSSIER: MedMat 3D Pro
**Concept & Strategy Document**

---

## 1. Executive Summary
MedMat 3D Pro is a high-fidelity AI-driven mechanical medical device designer. It bridges the critical gap between surgical intent and regulatory-ready engineering documentation. By integrating **Gemini 3 Pro** with a specialized clinical material database and 3D CAD visualization, MedMat 3D Pro automates the synthesis of biocompatible device architectures, performance simulations, and technical dossiers.

## 2. The Vision
To accelerate the lifecycle of life-saving medical hardware—reducing the transition time from clinical concept to "Technical File Ready" status from months to seconds. We empower engineers to explore safe, compliant, and optimized geometries using real-time generative intelligence.

## 3. Core Innovation
- **Gemini 3 Pro Synthesis**: Advanced reasoning engine for determining material biocompatibility and structural integrity.
- **ISO 10993 Alignment**: Automated screening of material Bill of Materials (BOM) against global safety standards.
- **Dynamic CAD Rendering**: Real-time orthographic visualization of synthesized mechanical architectures.
- **Automated Dossier Generation**: Instant creation of SDS, BOM, and Technical Files compliant with MDR 2017/745.
